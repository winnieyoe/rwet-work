       " 'Prazosin belongs to a class of medications called alpha blockers. It works by relaxing and widening blood vessels so blood can flow more easily.',\n",
       " 'HOW TO USE: Take this medication by mouth with or without food, usually two or three times daily or as directed by your doctor. If stomach upset occurs, take with food or milk. The dosage is based on your age, medical condition and response to therapy.',\n",
       " 'Prazosin can occasionally cause sudden fainting after the first dose and anytime that your dose is increased. To reduce your risk of fainting, the first dose prescribed by your doctor will be the smallest dose available. You should take this first dose as you are going to bed. This will decrease the possibility of fainting. Your dose may be gradually increased. Take your first new dose at bedtime when your dose is increased unless directed otherwise by your doctor.',\n",

It may take up to several weeks before the full benefit of this drug takes effect.',\n",

       " 'Lightheadedness or dizziness upon standing may also occur, especially after the first dose and shortly after taking a dose of the drug during the first week of treatment. To reduce the risk of dizziness and fainting, get up slowly when rising from a seated or lying position. If dizziness occurs, sit or lie down right away. Your dose may need to be adjusted.',\n",
